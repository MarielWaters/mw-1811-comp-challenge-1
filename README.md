# For this project...

we were asked to create a static site that recreates the layout of a provided comp, while being given creative liberty with theme, copy, icons, images, and color palette.

# The concept behind my version...

is an app that allows activists who have been arrested during direct actions to raise bail money for their release. With no regard for space and time, I selected a variety of iconic images that capture social movements from the last 100 years.

# My wishlist for this site is:

* to further dial in the responsiveness of the site. This especially includes the “Learn More About” in the middle of the cards and the longer names. I was lucky enough that there was enough space in the “Learn More About” container to still contain the text when it wrapped, but the same was not true for longer names at the top of the card. My way around this for the time being is overflow: hidden, but I know there must be a better way.

* to solve a responsiveness issue in FireFox that I did not encounter in Chrome or Safari, which is the logo image in the header dropping below the heading when the browser is reduced to about 540px.

* more alt tags in the html for accessibility purposes.

* to add hover state animations to the card that would rotate the cards, revealing a quote associated with either the activist or the movement they are/were a part of.

* to tighten up the historical accuracy. For example, I was only able to find the actual set bail amount for a few arrests. The ones that I did, like Rosa Parks, I converted to 2018 dollars.
